## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Minor Changes

- c1282f7: Make it easier to get different values from different builders and builds, from two
  adoption trials.

  - **Builder names.** Every builder takes a `name` option, for example
    `fromZod(LeadUuid, { name: 'LeadUuid' })`. A builder with a default session draws its
    session-less builds from `defaultSession().scope('builder', name)`, so two builders over
    identical schemas no longer return the same values. Zod's `brand()` is type-only, so
    `z.uuid().brand('LeadUuid')` and `z.uuid().brand('DealUuid')` are the same schema at
    runtime and need a name (or a shared session) to differ. `describe()` reports the name.
  - **`createTestSession(seed = 1)`** and `testSessionIdentity` in `@mimlet/core` create a
    session without an application identity, to share across the builds of one test so
    consecutive builds continue it instead of repeating the first value. Session-less builds
    still repeat the same values on every call, so a test's data never depends on which tests
    ran before it.
  - **Typed default sessions.** `defaultSession` is now a typed option of `fromZodFactory`,
    `fromZodFactoryAsync`, `fromArkTypeFactory`, both `fromTypeBoxFactory` entry points,
    `fromEffect`, `fromEffectAsync`, `fromEffectFactory`, `fromFaker`, `fromFakerSchema`,
    `fromArbitrary`, `fromSchemaArbitrary`, `fromAdapter` and an adapter's `fromFactory`, where
    it already worked at runtime. With a default session the factory may declare its session
    as required.
  - **Callbacks receive a session.** On builders with a default session, including every
    `fromZod()`, `fromTypeBox()` and other schema builder, `withFactory()`, `replaceFactory()`
    and transform callbacks are typed with `session: GenerationSession` instead of
    `session?: GenerationSession`. Callbacks that declare `session?` still compile. The
    builder interfaces take an optional fourth (schema builders) or third type argument for
    these callback arguments; it defaults to the build arguments.
  - **Tuple lists.** `buildList`, `buildValidatedList`, their async variants and scenario
    lists return a tuple for a literal count up to 64, so `const [a, b] = builder.buildList(2)`
    types both items under `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. A `number` count still returns an
    array. A `let` variable inferred from `buildList(2)` now has a two-item tuple type;
    annotate it as an array if you assign a list of another length to it.
  - **Scenarios.** `build()`, `buildList()` and their async variants take an optional session
    and use a fresh `createTestSession()` without one, where they used to fail with
    `ScenarioError` (cause `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'scope')`).
    `override()` and `trait()` factories now receive the node's declared dependencies as a
    second argument, `(session, dependencies)`, so a replaced derived node can keep its
    foreign keys. `Scenario` takes an optional third type argument that maps node names to
    their dependency names.

  Generated values: unnamed builders return the same values as in 0.1.0-beta.3, with or
  without a session, so existing fixtures and snapshots stay valid. Only builders you give a
  `name` produce new session-less values. A name never changes the values of a session you
  pass, and session snapshots recorded with 0.1.0-beta.3 replay identically; restoring one
  under another identity still fails with `INVALID_SESSION_REPLAY`. The documentation now
  states that a session's values depend only on its seed and scope path: the fingerprint,
  provider and configuration are checked by `restoreSession()` but do not change the values.

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- 6d167f1: Installs no longer fail when a native library ships a compatible release. Each
  adapter's peer range now runs from its oldest tested version up to the library's next
  major release, or the next minor for the 0.x `@sinclair/typebox`: `zod >=4.4.3 <5`,
  `valibot >=1.5.0 <2`, `arktype >=2.2.5 <3`, `effect >=4.0.0 <5`, `typebox >=1.3.34 <2`,
  `@sinclair/typebox >=0.34.48 <0.35`, `@faker-js/faker >=10.5.0 <11` and
  `fast-check >=4.10.2 <5`. Before, the peer range ended at the newest tested version,
  so `npm install effect@4.0.1 @mimlet/effect` failed with `ERESOLVE` as soon as Effect
  4.0.1 was published.

  The versions each release was tested with stay recorded, now in the package's
  `mimlet.testedPeers` field, and `mimlet doctor` warns when an installed version is newer
  than that. Effect 4.0.1 is now tested. `effectAdapter().metadata.version` names the
  loaded Effect release instead of always `4.0.0`, and
  `arkTypeAdapter().metadata.supportedVersions` is the new peer range.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- 1145c96: Export named builder types for generic helpers that need an explicit return type,
  for example under `@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type`.
  `TypeBoxBuilder<S>`, `TypeBoxFactoryBuilder<S, F>` and `TypeBoxVariantBuilder<S, I>`
  (with an optional context type in `@mimlet/typebox`), `ZodBuilder<S>` and
  `ZodFactoryBuilder<S, F>`, and `EffectBuilder<A, I>` and `EffectFactoryBuilder<A, I, F>`
  are exactly what `fromTypeBox()`, `fromTypeBoxFactory()`, `fromTypeBoxVariant()`,
  `fromZod()`, `fromZodFactory()`, `fromEffect()` and `fromEffectFactory()` return,
  also for a schema type parameter. A factory builder still gets its sync or async
  methods where the helper is called. This replaces the advice to leave such return
  types inferred or to write `ReturnType<typeof fromTypeBoxFactory<...>>`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f430f44]
  - @mimlet/core@0.1.0-beta.2

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- 3cd081a: Add `effectFields(schema)`, which lists a struct's top-level encoded keys for `fluent()`
  from `@mimlet/core`: `fluent(fromEffect(schema), effectFields(schema))` has a `withX()`
  setter per field, also in a generic helper. Keys renamed with `Schema.encodeKeys` are
  listed by their encoded name, because builders take encoded input. Non-struct schemas
  throw a `TypeError`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [536ca1e]
- Updated dependencies [a69850d]
  - @mimlet/core@0.1.0-beta.1

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- eba145d: Raise a `TypeError` that points to `fromEffectAsync` when a synchronous build or
  `inputArbitrary()` meets an asynchronous encoder, instead of Effect's internal
  "Sync adapter can only throw schema errors". Ordinary schema failures still surface as
  Effect's `SchemaError`. Exhausted sampling now suggests `fromEffectFactory`.
- Updated dependencies
- Updated dependencies [eba145d]
  - @mimlet/core@0.1.0-beta.0

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- f38ccc6: Target exactly `effect@4.0.0`, which npm now installs by default. Effect 4 removed
  the bundled fast-check, so generation samples Effect's own `effect/Arbitrary` engine
  from the explicit session with every sampling option fixed, and property tests use
  Effect's `Arbitrary.checkEffect` shrinking and replay. Each adapter converts its own
  Standard Schema wrapper, so parse options never leak between adapters or modify the
  caller's schema. Loading this release with Effect 3 throws a `TypeError` naming the
  required version; Effect 3 projects stay on the `0.1.0-alpha.3` train.
- @mimlet/core@0.1.0-alpha.4

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- 5bf6cd2: Raise a descriptive `TypeError` when `fromEffect` or `fromEffectAsync` builds without
  the required explicit session, instead of failing inside native sampling. Effect
  builders still have no default session; the types continue to require one.
- Updated dependencies [5bf6cd2]
  - @mimlet/core@0.1.0-alpha.3

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

Initial prerelease source for @mimlet/effect.

Native schema fixtures preserving input/output semantics and builder capabilities.

The package README defines supported behavior, tested dependency versions, and
explicit limitations. This changelog does not assert that the version has been
published or that every schema can be generated automatically.
